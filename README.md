# EPMA - Note Keeping App

Note Taking App for Android having 2 flavors (one for the premium version, and one for the freemium version - ads -). Those flavors have different color schemes, and some texts are changed just for showing how the flavors work.

## How to use

The app has two fragments, the first one showing is the listing of notes. There the user can see all notes created. Then they can add notes by pressing the floating button on the bottom right part of the screen. 

After clicking, it shows the second fragment, where a new note can be created. A note MUST have a title and a description, otherwise nothing would ocurr when trying to save the note. Finally, to create the note the user has to press the new button on the bottom right part of the screen. 

TIP: When the user is typing the title or description the keyboard is shown and this button gets hidden behind the keyboard popup. So to save the note, the user must first close the keyboard popup.
